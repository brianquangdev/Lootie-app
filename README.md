## ü™ô Tokenomics

Lootie uses a dual-token system to optimize both utility and governance:

### **LOOT Token (Native Token)**
- Main medium of exchange in the ecosystem
- Used for transaction fees, staking, governance
- Deflationary mechanics: token burning from transaction fees and quest rewards

### **QUEST Token (Utility Token)**
- Distributed through quest completion and community activities
- Used to purchase in-game items, unlock premium features, participate in special events
- Can be converted to LOOT via bonding curve

### **Token Use Cases**
- Transaction fees & gas abstraction (users interact without direct gas)
- Quest rewards & incentives (daily, seasonal, community)
- Staking & governance (unlock perks, vote on protocol upgrades)
- Marketplace & trading (NFTs, in-game items, loot crates)
- Season pass & progression system
- Creator & collab economy (custom quest packs, analytics, rewards)
- Cross-game utility & player identity
- Deflationary design & burn mechanics

### **Token Allocation**
- Ecosystem Growth: 35%
- Team & Advisors: 20%
- Community Treasury: 18%
- Strategic Investors: 15%
- Liquidity & Market Making: 7%
- Operational Reserve: 5%

## üßë‚Äçüíª Lootie Protocol SDK

Lootie is designed as modular infrastructure. Each core module (wallet, quest engine, lootbox, analytics) can be exported as SDKs or smart contract packages for other games/platforms to integrate.

- **QuestModule.sol**: Smart contract for on-chain missions, daily/seasonal/achievement quests, reward distribution.
- **LootBoxCore.sol**: NFT-based lootbox engine, randomized drops, rarity, composable reward logic.
- **WalletEmbed.js**: Frontend JS module for Privy social login, embedded wallet, transaction signing, gas abstraction.
- **ChainletDeployer.ts**: CLI tool for rapid chainlet deployment with Lootie modules.
- **AnalyticsAPI.ts**: Backend module for player behavior, quest data, economic metrics.

**Open-source License:**  
Lootie Protocol SDK is governed under the Lootie Modular License (LML):  
- Free to use SDK modules to build games on Saga Chainlets
- Cannot fork/clone the full Lootie Hub or UI, or use the ‚ÄúLootie‚Äù brand without permission
