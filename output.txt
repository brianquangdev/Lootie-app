1. Executive Summary

🎮 Lootie: The Super Hub for Web3 Gamers
Lootie is a Web3 gaming super hub built to solve the biggest challenges in the space:
confusing UX, poor player retention, and a lack of unified platforms. While 75% of
Web3 games fail shortly after launch and 60% of players churn within the first month,
Lootie is here to change the game.
Powered by Saga’s Chainlet tech, each game or user gets their own dedicated chain unlocking near-zero gas, instant performance, and zero congestion.
Onboarding is frictionless with Web2 login via Privy, and game developers get robust

tools via Thirdweb.
Lootie offers:
●​ An on-chain quest system that ties directly into gameplay​
●​ A built-in, Chainlet-native wallet (no external connection needed)​
●​ A game discovery hub with curated listings​
●​ Event modules and community campaigns for engagement​
●​ Seamless onboarding, fun retention loops, and real rewards​

🧩
More than a product, Lootie is an evolving protocol. While we begin with a
user-focused super app, our architecture is modular - allowing studios to integrate
Lootie’s quest engine, wallet, or analytics directly into their own Chainlets.

Think of Lootie as a “Steam for Web3” - but one where every game can become its own
sovereign ecosystem. Our mission: onboard the next generation of gamers from Web2
to Web3 - through play, not speculation.

1.1) Technology overview:
a) Chainlet Saga
Saga is a Layer 1 blockchain protocol designed to make it easy for developers to
launch dedicated, parallel, interoperable blockchains, called “Chainlets”. Each Chainlet
is a standalone blockchain with a virtual machine (VM) module running a single smart
contract. This provides unique performance and horizontal scalability.
Saga's Chainlets solve the congestion and high transaction fees common on public
blockchains by providing dedicated block space for each application. This is especially
beneficial for gaming applications, which require high throughput and low latency.
Chainlets are secured by Saga's validators, ensuring security and decentralization.

b) Privy and Thirdweb
Privy is a wallet infrastructure solution that simplifies user onboarding to Web3. Privy
allows developers to integrate embedded wallets into their applications, removing the
complexity of requiring users to register for a wallet.

crypto externally. With Privy, users can log in using familiar Web2 methods (such as
email, phone number, social media accounts) and automatically generate a
non-custodial wallet seamlessly. This significantly reduces the barrier to entry for new
users, especially Web2 gamers.
Thirdweb is a comprehensive Web3 development platform that provides tools and
SDKs for building, managing, and analyzing Web3 applications. Thirdweb makes it
easy for developers to deploy smart contracts, create NFTs, and integrate blockchain
features into their applications without requiring in-depth blockchain knowledge. With
multi-language SDKs (React, React Native, TypeScript, Python, Go, Unity),
Thirdweb speeds up development and allows Lootie Wallet to focus on building the
core user experience.

2. Problem Statement
2.1 Market Overview
Web3 gaming doesn’t lack products, it lacks the infrastructure for real retention and
growth.
Between 2018 and the end of 2024, an estimated 3,602 blockchain games were
launched. Yet by the end of 2024, only around 1,361 of them (roughly 37.8%) still
showed any on-chain activity - meaning over 62% had gone inactive.​
Meanwhile, data from CoinGecko indicates that from 2018 to 2023, of the 2,817
games launched, as many as 2,127 games (around 75–80%) failed - losing over 99%
of their users from peak activity.
And yet, the potential of this market remains massive. Blockchain introduces
transparent asset ownership, open economies, and cross-game interoperability things that Web2 platforms were never built to support. Industry projections estimate
that by 2034, the global Web3 gaming market could reach hundreds of billions of
dollars.
The problem isn’t about building games. It’s about growing them.
Most Web3 games follow the same broken loop: launch a big campaign, onboard users
through short-term incentives, then lose them the moment the rewards stop. With no

native infrastructure for onboarding, retention, or player re-engagement, even
promising games struggle to scale. Community becomes fragmented. Data is lost.
Developers are forced to start over - again and again.
Meanwhile, the potential of the Web3 gaming market is undeniable. Blockchain
enables transparent ownership, open economies, and true interoperability - core
features that Web2 never offered. Industry forecasts predict that this space will reach
hundreds of billions in market size by 2034. Major gaming companies are already
entering. But technology alone doesn’t drive growth - infrastructure does.
This is the gap Lootie was built to fill.
Lootie is the missing growth layer for Web3 gaming - the one thing this
industry desperately needs but never had.
Lootie gives every game a plug-and-play growth engine: non-custodial wallet
onboarding, gamified quests, loot-based reward systems, social leaderboard
mechanics, creator collaboration, and player behavior analytics - all built into one SDK.
No smart contract changes. No technical debt. Just growth infrastructure, out of the
box.
2.2 Who Needs This?
Lootie is designed for the people most affected by this growth gap:
●​ Web3 Game Developers​
Indie teams or studios building great games but struggling to onboard users,
retain them, or build momentum after launch. Most lack the internal resources
to build full growth systems from scratch.​
●​ Ecosystem Operators & Chain Foundations​
L1s and modular chains (like Saga) that want to support sustainable user
acquisition across their ecosystem, but lack a unified layer for player identity,
analytics, and engagement.​
●​ Web2 Gamers Exploring Web3​
Curious but discouraged by complex onboarding flows, wallet UX, seed phrases,
and fragmented tools. Lootie abstracts all of this away with social login,
simplified UX, and gameplay-centric incentives.​

●​ Web3 Power Users​
Players who already engage in Web3, but currently experience reward fatigue,
high gas costs, and zero long-term retention. Lootie reintroduces a sense of
progress, identity, and community.
2.3 Competitive Landscape

Why Not Use Existing Platforms Like Galxe, Zealy, or Steam?
When teams hear about Lootie, a common question arises: “Why not just use Galxe,
Zealy, or even Steam?”
It’s a fair question, and one we’ve considered seriously. But while these platforms each
play a role in today’s ecosystem, they were not built to support the long-term,
gamified, user-centric growth that Web3 games truly need.
Galxe and Zealy are campaign tools, not growth systems.​
They are optimized for short-term participation: join a Discord server, retweet a post,
mint an NFT, and move on. While effective at driving traffic spikes, they fail to create
meaningful retention. Users often complete a task, claim a reward, and leave. There’s
no sense of identity, no re
QuestN attempts to solve this with more flexible campaign structures. It allows
multi-step quests and deeper integration, but remains transactional at its core. There
is still no feeling of progression, no seasonal structure, and no feedback loop that
encourages continued play. The user journey ends with the campaign, not continues
beyond it.
Steam, as a Web2 platform, is an entirely different story. It is arguably the most
successful distribution system in gaming history. However, Steam is fundamentally
incompatible with Web3. It does not integrate wallets, does not support tokenized
assets, and does not allow developers to build open economies or connect to on-chain
systems. For Web3 games, Steam is closed infrastructure.
Lootie was built to fill this gap - and go further.
We’re not a quest tool. We’re a full-stack growth infrastructure layer for Web3 games.
From the first user click to the 100th day of engagement, Lootie is designed to manage

and optimize the entire user journey. We combine:
●​ A native wallet for seamless onboarding​
●​ Daily and seasonal quest systems​
●​ Leaderboards, loot rewards, and player XP​
●​ NFT customization and social gameplay​
●​ Player identity that persists across games and chains​

Beyond engagement, Lootie delivers something these platforms cannot: insight.​
We provide developers with deep behavioral data - who joined, who stayed, who
dropped off, and why. Our analytics layer gives teams the tools to test campaigns,
segment users, and continuously improve both gameplay and retention strategies.
In short, Galxe, Zealy, and QuestN are marketing utilities. Steam is a distribution
channel. But Lootie is the first platform designed to be a growth engine for Web3
gaming - modular, gamified, data-rich, and cross-chain by default.

3. Solution
Lootie | A Modular Growth Layer for Web3 Gaming
Web3 gaming is full of promise, but most games today fail not because of bad
gameplay, but because they lack a sustainable way to onboard, engage, and retain
users. Lootie was created to fix exactly that: become the missing growth layer that
every Web3 game and ecosystem can plug into.
A Cross-Chain Growth Layer for Ecosystems

The current Web3 gaming landscape is fragmented. Each game, each chain, each
campaign operates in silos. There’s no unified infrastructure to support player
onboarding, identity, and engagement across the ecosystem.
Lootie changes that. We offer a chain-agnostic SDK that works across EVM and
modular chains, enabling:
●​ A persistent player identity across games and chains​

●​ Unified tracking of player behavior and asset ownership​
●​ A growth toolkit that any chain can offer to its game studios, out of the box​
For ecosystems like Saga, Lootie becomes a ready-made growth engine - helping
every new game onboard faster, retain longer, and measure results clearly.

Lootie as a Cross-Chain Growth Gateway
Most new chains and gaming ecosystems struggle with one critical challenge: user
acquisition. Even with strong infrastructure and developer tools, attracting active
players, especially from outside the ecosystem remains difficult and expensive.
Lootie solves this by acting as a cross-chain growth gateway.
Players from Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, and other major ecosystems can onboard
into Lootie using their existing wallets. From there, they’re introduced to new games including those on emerging chains like Saga, without needing to switch wallets,
bridge tokens, or understand new chain mechanics.
This means:
●​ Games on Saga can attract users from other chains effortlessly​
●​ Lootie handles onboarding, quest design, and identity — so games don’t have to​
●​ The entire Saga ecosystem benefits from access to a ready-made, cross-chain
player base​
By aggregating players, Lootie creates network effects across games and chains. A
player might come for one campaign on Polygon, but stay to explore a Saga-based
RPG - and earn loot along the way.
For Indie and Small Games: Plug-and-Play Growth

Building a Web3 game is already hard. Building a custom wallet, quest system, and
analytics dashboard? Nearly impossible for small teams.
Lootie solves this by offering a plug-and-play growth stack:
●​ A Lootie Wallet, designed for gaming (not finance), simple to integrate and easy
for new users​
●​ A Quest Hub with daily tasks, seasonal challenges, loot-based progression, and
XP​
●​ Player profiles, NFT inventories, and cross-game achievements​

●​ Event-ready infrastructure to launch quests, collabs, and campaigns in minutes​
No need to build data pipelines. Just connect, customize, and go live.
For Bigger Games: Better Retention, Lower CAC

Even well-funded Web3 games suffer from retention fatigue. After launch, most rely on
KOL campaigns or airdrops to keep users engaged, both expensive and ineffective in
the long run.
Lootie provides built-in retention mechanics:
●​ Seasonal passes with unlockable NFT rewards​
●​ Leaderboard competitions to encourage community activity​
●​ Custom item collection, allowing players to personalize avatars and NFTs​
●​ Collab Board, connecting games to creators for ongoing content and quests​
By embedding engagement inside the gameplay experience, Lootie reduces the need
for external ad spend and makes retention part of your core loop — not an
afterthought.
For Players: One Wallet, Many Worlds

Lootie makes Web3 gaming feel like gaming again.
Players use the Lootie Wallet to:
●​ Onboard quickly with social login (no seed phrases) with Privy​
●​ Track their assets (NFTs, tokens, XP) across multiple games​
●​ Join daily quests, complete seasonal objectives, and earn loot​
●​ Collect, customize, and unlock NFTs as they play​
Instead of managing five wallets and chasing airdrops, players have a single identity
and a unified profile - making their Web3 journey social, fun, and sticky.
Growth Infrastructure, Not Just a Tool

Lootie is not a marketing plugin. It’s not “just another quest app.” We’re building the
growth infrastructure that Web3 gaming actually needs - and we’re making it
accessible to every game, regardless of size or budget.
From campaign activation to retention analytics, Lootie helps games:

●​ Cut down growth costs​
●​ Increase LTV and engagement​
●​ Understand players deeply through first-party data​
●​ Launch experiments, A/B test mechanics, and scale what works​
If Steam was the distribution layer for Web2 gaming, Lootie is the growth layer
for Web3. Not just for one game - for the entire chain.

4. Architecture / Technical Design

4.2 Description of main modules (Wallet, Quest, Transaction,
Analytics…)
Wallet Module: The Wallet Module is the heart of the Lootie Wallet, providing secure
and efficient digital asset management. The module integrates with Privy to create
embedded wallets for users without requiring them to understand private keys or
seed phrases. Each wallet is powered by a separate Saga Chainlet, ensuring fast
transactions and low fees. The Wallet Module supports multi-chain assets, allowing
users to manage tokens, NFTs, and other assets from multiple blockchains in a unified
interface.
Quest Module: Quest Module is one of the most unique features of Lootie Wallet,
designed to increase engagement and create value for players. The module allows
game developers and communities to create diverse quests, from in-game activities to
social interactions. The quest system is deeply integrated with smart contracts,
automatically verifying quest completion and distributing rewards. Quest Module also
supports different types of quests such as daily quests, seasonal events, community
challenges and achievement systems.
Transaction Module: The Transaction Module handles all blockchain transactions
within the Lootie Wallet ecosystem. Thanks to the Saga Chainlet architecture, the
module can handle thousands of transactions per second with extremely low latency.
The Transaction Module also integrates gas abstraction, allowing users to make
transactions without worrying about gas fees. The module supports different types of
transactions

including

token

transfers,

NFT

minting/trading,

smart

contract

interactions, and cross-chain bridges.
Analytics Module: Analytics Module provides detailed insights into user activity,
game performance and market trends. This module collects and analyzes data
whether
from all activities in the ecosystem, from completing quests to trading assets. This
data is used to optimize user experience, improve game mechanics, and provide
valuable information to developers. The Analytics Module also supports real-time

monitoring and alerting for important events.
Community Module: The Community Module creates a social space within Lootie
Wallet where players can connect, share experiences, and participate in community
activities. The module includes features such as chat systems, forums, leaderboards,
guild management, and event organization. The Community Module also integrates
with the Quest Module to create community quests and group challenges,
encouraging collaboration and interaction between members.

4.3 Transition from Product to Protocol
Lootie is initially built as a full-featured product - a comprehensive Web3 gaming hub
that combines wallet, quests, rewards, and community features into a seamless user
experience. This product-first approach allows us to test, refine, and optimize the core
Lootie modules in a real environment with actual users and games.
However, Lootie is designed from day one to evolve beyond a standalone app. Its
architecture is modular, extensible, and protocol-ready, making it possible to export
individual components (wallet, quest engine, lootbox logic, analytics) as SDKs or smart
contract packages.
Lootie as Modular Infrastructure for the Saga Ecosystem
Each of Lootie’s modules - from Quest System to Transaction Engine - is designed to
be deployed independently by other games or platforms, not just within the Lootie
hub.
In particular, Lootie’s SDK enables external game studios to:
●​ Deploy Lootie-powered quests, lootboxes, or wallets on their own Chainlet​
●​ Customize reward logic via Lootie’s audited smart contracts​
●​ Plug into Lootie’s analytics & leaderboard infrastructure​

This positions Lootie not just as a product, but as an ecosystem growth engine for
Saga, where every new integration becomes a new Chainlet, and every game becomes
a self-contained economy powered by the Lootie Protocol.

Lootie Wallet is also deployable as a standalone module on any Saga Chainlet, allowing
external developers to embed full wallet logic into their own games or dApps.

5. Tokenomics

5.1 Token used: Native or ERC20?
Lootie Wallet uses a dual-token system to optimize both utility and governance in
the ecosystem. The system includes:
LOOT Token (Native Token): LOOT is the native token of the Lootie Wallet ecosystem,
built on the Saga Chainlet infrastructure. This token serves as the main medium of
exchange in the ecosystem, used for paying transaction fees, staking to receive
rewards, and participating in governance decisions. LOOT token is designed with
deflationary mechanics through token burning from transaction fees and quest
completion rewards.
QUEST Token (Utility Token): QUEST is a utility token distributed through quest
completion and community activities. This token can be used to purchase in-game
items, unlock premium features, and participate in special events. QUEST tokens can
be converted to LOOT tokens through a bonding curve mechanism, creating utility
and demand for both tokens.

5.2 Use cases of tokens in Lootie
The $LOOT token plays a central role in driving growth, incentivizing behaviors, and
powering interactions across the Lootie ecosystem. It is designed as a
multi-functional utility token, supporting players, developers, creators, and the
ecosystem at large.

●​ Transaction Fees & Gas Abstraction

Lootie integrates a gas abstraction layer that allows users to interact with on-chain
features without directly paying gas in native tokens. Instead, $LOOT is used as the
medium for transaction fees, either deducted from user balances, sponsored via
quest rewards, or covered by ecosystem contributions. This lowers the barrier for
onboarding new users, especially those unfamiliar with wallet management and chain
mechanics.
●​ Quest Rewards & Incentives

Both $LOOT and QUEST tokens are distributed as rewards for:
●​ Completing daily and seasonal quests​
●​ Participating in community challenges or mini-games​
●​ Contributing to early-stage campaigns and ecosystem growth​
Reward logic is governed by smart contracts, considering factors like quest difficulty,
completion rate, and user impact. This encourages authentic, repeated engagement
and filters out low-effort behavior.
●​ Staking & Governance

Users and studios can stake $LOOT for various benefits:
●​ Players: Unlock XP multipliers, exclusive quests, early access content​
●​ Studios: Stake to gain promotional slots like “Spotlight Game” or feature
banners​
Staked token holders can also participate in platform governance - voting on protocol
upgrades, quest logic changes, reward structures, or ecosystem grants. Over time,
Lootie will transition toward a DAO model with more community-driven control.
●​ Marketplace & Trading

$LOOT is used as the main currency inside the Lootie marketplace:
●​ Buying/selling NFTs, in-game items, and seasonal collectibles​
●​ Unlocking cosmetic upgrades or customizations​
●​ Collecting loot crates, packs, and event-based assets​
Marketplace fees are charged in $LOOT, and a portion of these fees is burned regularly
to support token scarcity and long-term sustainability.

●​ Season Pass & Progression System

Players can use $LOOT to:
●​ Purchase Lootie Passes for each seasonal event​
●​ Access exclusive quests, character cosmetics, and limited-time loot​
●​ Progress through battle-pass style levels and earn rare rewards​
This creates a familiar but powerful loop of engagement, reward, and reinvestment,
similar to Web2 gaming models - now adapted for on-chain environments.
●​ Creator & Collab Economy

Through the Collab Board, creators can:
●​ Design and deploy custom quest packs​
●​ Earn $LOOT based on verified content performance​
●​ Access analytics and creator tools for growth​
This system enables a micro-creator economy where developers, streamers, and guilds
are rewarded for driving engagement into the Lootie ecosystem.
●​ Cross-Game Utility & Player Identity

$LOOT acts as a unifying token across multiple games, enabling:
●​ Cross-game NFT unlocks and customization​
●​ Identity-linked perks and social status (e.g., badges, collectibles)​
●​ A persistent player profile tied to $LOOT activity and reputation​
This helps players carry value and progress across different games, reducing
fragmentation and increasing lifetime value (LTV).
●​ Deflationary Design & Burn Mechanics

To ensure long-term token health, Lootie integrates deflationary mechanisms:
●​ Unclaimed rewards are periodically burned​
●​ A share of season pass fees and marketplace transactions are burned​
●​ Optional early withdrawal penalties from staking may contribute to burn
pool​

This helps maintain supply discipline while reinforcing value for active participants.

5.3 How to mint/send and receive
Token Minting: $LOOT tokens are minted through a controlled emission schedule,
with the majority allocated for quest rewards, community incentives and ecosystem
development. Initial token distribution includes allocations for the team, advisors,
early investors and community treasury. QUEST tokens are minted dynamically based
on quest completion and community activities.
Sending and Receiving: Token transfers in the Lootie ecosystem are simplified
through user-friendly interfaces. Users can send tokens using usernames instead of
complex wallet addresses. Cross-chain transfers are supported through bridge
mechanisms, allowing users to move tokens between different blockchains in the
ecosystem.
Wallet Integration: Tokens được automatically managed trong Lootie Wallet
interface, với real-time balance updates và transaction history. Users có thể easily
track token earnings từ quests, view staking rewards và monitor portfolio
performance thông qua integrated analytics dashboard.

5.4 Tokenomics Allocation
The $LOOT token powers the entire Lootie ecosystem from user incentives to seasonal
passes, creator rewards, and DAO governance. We designed our tokenomics not for
speculation, but for utility-driven growth and long-term sustainability.
Here’s how we plan to allocate the total supply:
1. Ecosystem Growth (35%)

This is the engine for onboarding users and games.​
We allocate 35% of the total supply to fund:
●​ User reward pools (daily quests, seasonal loot, leaderboard prizes)​
●​ Strategic partnerships with games, guilds, and creators​

●​ Campaign grants to bootstrap early community activity​
This ensures that the $LOOT token is constantly used to create value and
engagement inside the platform.
2. Team & Advisors (20%)

Reserved for the core contributors building and scaling Lootie.​
We apply a 12-month cliff and 36-month linear vesting to ensure long-term alignment.​
This pool also includes key advisors from gaming, Web3 infra, and ecosystem
partners.
3. Community Treasury (18%)

Governed by the Lootie DAO in the future, this treasury will be used for:
●​ Funding user-voted features​
●​ Supporting community-created events, quests, and mini-games​
●​ Running hackathons or bounty programs for developer tools​
It reflects our belief that Lootie should be community-extended — not just
team-led.​

4. Strategic Investors (15%)

Allocated for pre-seed, seed, and future strategic rounds. Funds raised will be used to:
●​ Develop core infrastructure​
●​ Scale user acquisition​
●​ Expand to multiple chains and onboard more games​
We prioritize long-term partners who can bring distribution, ecosystem access,
and deep gaming experience.​

5. Liquidity & Market Making (7%)

Reserved for initial DEX/CEX liquidity, staking pools, and ensuring healthy token utility

across platforms. This pool enables smooth in-app usage of $LOOT and makes staking,
swapping, and earning seamless for users.
6. Operational Reserve (5%)

A buffer for unforeseen needs, protocol maintenance, and future ecosystem initiatives.
This pool will be managed transparently and will follow governance input over time.
Token burns:

A portion of unclaimed rewards, expired passes, and certain

platform fees will be burned periodically - reinforcing a deflationary pressure that
rewards long-term participation and staking.
5.5 Sustainable Growth Without Dependency on Token Incentives
Unlike many task-based platforms that rely heavily on one-time token rewards to
attract and retain users, Lootie is designed to grow through intrinsic value loops not artificial incentives.
At the heart of Lootie’s design is a self-sustaining engagement cycle:
User → Takes action → Receives value → Returns → Contributes more →
Unlocks deeper benefits
Rather than encouraging extraction-based behavior, Lootie builds meaningful reasons
to return, such as daily quests, seasonal progress, leaderboard competition, and
NFT-based progression. The system rewards behavior that strengthens the ecosystem
long-term, not just short-term participation.
This model is supported by internal economic drivers, including:
●​ Lootie Pass subscriptions that grant access to exclusive quests, cosmetics, and
events​
●​ Marketplace transaction fees, with a portion allocated to platform
sustainability and token burn​
●​ Staking mechanics that reward long-term commitment and unlock platform
perks​
●​ A growing creator economy via the Collab Board, where creators earn $LOOT

for verified engagement - creating a positive-sum loop between content,
players, and games​

Through this structure, Lootie aims to gradually reduce reliance on token emissions
while increasing the utility, demand, and retention power of $LOOT. It’s not just a
platform that pays users to show up - it’s a system that gives them reasons to stay,
progress, and own their journey.

player engagement metrics. This creates sustainable business models for indie
developers.

7. Differences
7.1 How is Lootie Wallet different from Galxe, Zealy, Steam,
Magic Eden, Space3?
a. Galxe & Zealy
Focus: Mainly marketing platform, community building, creating tasks to attract users
to participate in airdrop campaigns, marketing for the project.
Limitations: No deep integration into gameplay, no addressing of wallet experience or
blockchain performance for gamers.
Lootie: More than just a quest platform, Lootie integrates directly into the gaming
experience with its proprietary Chainlet-based wallet, enabling smooth transactions,
near-zero gas fees, and a quest system tied to in-game assets and activities.

b. Steam
Focus: Largest Web2 game distribution platform, no blockchain support, no digital
asset integration, limited Web3 games.
Limitations: No real ownership of digital assets, no transparency, no support for
transition to Web3.
Lootie: Bring Web3 experience (asset ownership, transparency, onchain transactions)
but still keep the simplicity and convenience of Steam. Be a bridge to help Web2
gamers switch to Web3 easily, aiming to become the "Steam of Web3 gaming".

c. Magic Eden

Focus: Leading NFT marketplace, mainly serving trading, buying and selling NFTs.
Limitations: No focus on gameplay experience, no quest system or gameplay
integration.
Lootie: Integrate NFT management, digital assets right in the wallet, but the focus is
on a comprehensive gaming wallet, a reward task system associated with gameplay,
creating real value for players.

4. Space3
Focus: Web3 quest platform, gamification, helps projects engage users through
quests, rewards, NFTs, tokens.
Limitations: Mainly a marketing bridge between project and users, not deeply
integrated into gameplay or wallet experience.
Looti: Outstanding with Chainlet-based wallet integration, real-time gameplay-based
quests, digital asset management, simple Web2 onboarding, and a powerful
development toolkit for game studios. Lootie is not only a place to complete quests
and receive rewards, but also a place to use, trade, and earn digital assets directly in
the game.

8.3 Further future (DAO, ecosystem…)
2027–2028: Ecosystem Expansion & DAO Activation

Starting in 2027, Lootie will transition from a product-focused platform into a
full-fledged Web3 gaming infrastructure layer, expanding its reach through
partnerships, new chains, and community-led development.
Key strategic directions include:
●​ Major Game Studio Partnerships​
Collaborate with leading Web2 and Web3 gaming studios to integrate Lootie’s
growth layer natively into large-scale titles, bringing Lootie to mainstream
audiences.​
●​ Cross-Chain Expansion​
Extend beyond the initial integration with Saga into major ecosystems like
Ethereum L2s, Solana, Avalanche, and Modular chains - allowing players and
games from multiple chains to join one unified gamified layer.​
●​ AI-Powered Systems​
Launch advanced features such as:​
○​ AI-generated dynamic quests, tailored to user behavior​
○​ Predictive analytics for optimizing campaign performance, player
retention, and asset valuation​
○​ On-chain reputation scoring and adaptive difficulty to reward meaningful
engagement​
●​ Lootie DAO Activation​

Governance will be progressively handed over to the community through the
Lootie DAO, including:​
○​ Platform development prioritization​
○​ Ecosystem grants and creator incentives​
○​ Treasury management and tokenomics tuning​
●​ Lootie Gaming Accelerator​
Establish a program to incubate and co-launch high-potential games that
integrate Lootie SDKs - offering funding, onboarding tools, growth support, and
access to Lootie’s playerbase.​
●​ Ecosystem APIs & SDKs​
Release self-serve infrastructure (SDKs, APIs, analytics) for indie developers,
creators, and studios to plug into Lootie with minimal effort - making it a
platform anyone can build on.​
Lootie Chainlet Launcher: We will offer Lootie Chainlet Templates - pre-built
game logic modules deployable via CLI or dashboard. Each studio gets a
dedicated chainlet running:
●​ On-chain quest contract​
●​ Lootbox NFT minting engine​
●​ Onboarding + analytics​
This allows indie teams to launch a Web3 game in hours, not weeks - on their own
chainlet.
LootOps – Community Growth Layer: Lootie will enable players and creators to launch
their own “micro-quests” and “user-generated loot campaigns.” These will:
●​ Be hosted on micro chainlets​
●​ Use QUEST/$LOOT as reward logic​
●​ Be composable with any game SDK​
This unlocks community-owned user acquisition - every player becomes a potential
quest launcher, bootstrapping usage for the entire Saga ecosystem.

2028+: Platform Evolution & Global Expansion

From 2028 onward, Lootie will evolve into a comprehensive Web3 entertainment
platform, extending beyond gaming into new forms of digital interaction and
ownership.
Key long-term milestones:
●​ Lootie Wallet → Web3 Entertainment Hub​
Expand the Lootie Wallet into a superapp that supports:​
○​ Onboarding for games, creators, and fans​
○​ In-app access to virtual events, livestreams, fan collectibles, and creator
passes​
○​ Smart portfolio tools for tracking NFTs, in-game tokens, and user
progression across multiple chains​
●​ Support for Other Entertainment Verticals​
Integrate Lootie’s gamified model into other digital verticals such as:​
○​ Virtual concerts and fan communities​
○​ Digital fashion and avatar collectibles​
○​ Metaverse-linked campaigns with real-world brand tie-ins​
●​ Global Growth & Localization​
Roll out localized versions of the Lootie platform for key gaming regions:
Southeast Asia, Latin America, Korea, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East —
adapting UX, quest logic, and community content for regional preferences.​
●​ Ecosystem Goals by 2028​
○​ Over 1 million active users across all chains​
○​ Integration with 1,000+ games, applications, and virtual experiences​
○​ Become the default growth layer adopted by ecosystems, gaming DAOs,
and L2s​
○​ Establish Lootie as the standard for user engagement in Web3 gaming​
Long-term, Lootie will no longer be just a platform - it will become the
invisible engine behind the next generation of interactive, gamified,
decentralized entertainment.

9. Appendix A – Lootie Protocol SDK Overview
The Lootie Protocol SDK represents the modular infrastructure underlying the Lootie
ecosystem. While the Lootie application operates as a full-featured Web3 gaming hub,
each core module powering the platform is designed for composability and
independent deployment. The SDK enables external game studios and developers to
adopt specific components, such as quest systems, wallet modules, and analytics tools,
and integrate them directly into their own Saga Chainlets.
QuestModule.sol provides the core smart contract logic for creating, verifying, and
rewarding on-chain missions. Developers can implement daily, seasonal, and
achievement-based quests, which integrate directly with gameplay or community
engagement layers. The module interfaces with Lootie’s reward distribution contract
(RewardVault.sol) and can be deployed across multiple chainlets.
LootBoxCore.sol serves as the backbone of Lootie’s NFT-based lootbox engine. It
supports randomized item drops, rarity-based distributions, and composable reward
logic. This contract is optimized for gas efficiency and can be adapted for both in-game
drops and marketplace-linked box systems.
WalletEmbed.js is a frontend JavaScript module enabling seamless onboarding
through Privy’s social login and embedded wallet generation. It abstracts transaction
signing and gas handling, allowing developers to provide a Web2-like onboarding
experience while maintaining non-custodial control. The module is compatible with all
Lootie-supported modules and native to Saga Chainlet environments.
ChainletDeployer.ts is a developer-facing CLI tool for rapidly deploying new
Lootie-powered Chainlets. It provisions a dedicated Chainlet via Saga CLI and initializes
the required Lootie modules. This tool is intended to streamline developer experience
and reduce time-to-launch for games integrating Lootie’s infrastructure.
AnalyticsAPI.ts (beta) is an optional backend module providing access to player
behavior, quest completion data, and economic metrics across Lootie-integrated
Chainlets. Developers may self-host the service or opt-in to Lootie’s hosted analytics
layer for simplified integration and aggregated reporting.
The Lootie Protocol SDK is governed under the Lootie Modular License (LML), a
hybrid open-source license that encourages ecosystem adoption while preserving key
brand and business rights.
This license allows developers to freely build with Lootie infrastructure while
preventing direct cloning of the Lootie Hub or brand.
By open-sourcing core SDK modules under LML, Lootie accelerates protocol adoption
while maintaining strategic defensibility.

What developers can do:
●​ Use SDK modules to build their own games on Saga Chainlets​
●​ Modify or extend quest/lootbox logic​

●​ Launch chainlets with Lootie modules embedded​

What’s restricted:
●​ Cannot fork or clone the full Lootie Hub or UI​
●​ Cannot use the “Lootie” brand name without express permission​
●​ Cannot offer SDK modules as a competing service or resale​

Why open-source SDK?
Lootie’s long-term goal is to become the infra backbone of gaming on Saga. By
allowing others to build with Lootie’s modules:
●​ We accelerate the number of high-quality Chainlets​
●​ We extend Lootie’s reach into games we don’t build​
●​ We position Lootie as the unifying layer across isolated gaming economies​
Every time a game integrates Lootie SDK, it creates a new touchpoint with
our infrastructure — increasing Lootie’s network value, visibility, and
adoption.

Why SDK Matters for Protocolization
Releasing SDK modules as standalone building blocks allows Lootie to evolve beyond a
single product into a protocol-level growth layer.
●​ Developers build games with Lootie modules → create more Chainlets​
●​ Ecosystems adopt Lootie SDK → boost composability and user activity​
●​ Every integration strengthens Lootie’s presence as infra, not just app​
This aligns with Lootie's long-term vision: become the standard growth infrastructure
for Web3 gaming.
